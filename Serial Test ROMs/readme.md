<H3>Test Roms</H3>
<p>
Ive asembled some test programs here which allow me to test the computer's SBC over serial, for the most part they are simple programs but they all are designed to load into David Dunfield's MONZ80.  I spent a TON of time formatting the code for the monitor and getting it to compile in zasm. You can find the monitor in the modules directory of this repository.
