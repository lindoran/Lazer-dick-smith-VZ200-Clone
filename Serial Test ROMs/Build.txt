Build Instructions for Serial Test ROMs
=======================================

Requirements:
-------------
You will need the following tools installed:
- SDCC (Small Device C Compiler)
- zasm (Z80 assembler)
- srecord (for manipulating binary files)
- xxd (hex dump utility)
- GNU make

Submodule Setup:
----------------
If the submodule is missing, initialize and update it with:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

Building Everything:
--------------------
To build all targets, simply run:

    make

This will compile the source code and generate the required ROM files.

Directory Structure After Build:
-------------------------------
After building, the subfolders are organized as follows:

- `bin/`  
  Contains the final ROM binaries ready for use.

- `obj/`  
  Contains intermediate object files generated during compilation.

- `src/`  
  Contains the source code for the project.

- `tools/`  
  Contains scripts and utilities used in the build process.

Notes:
------
- Ensure all required tools are available in your PATH.
- If you encounter errors related to missing tools, install them using your system's package manager.
